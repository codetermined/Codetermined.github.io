### What is Co-Determined?

Co-Determined! is a blog about progressive politics, cooperation, and goodwill. 

I'm interested in one fundamental question: how do we structure society in the most just and equitable way? Everything I write flows from there. 

### Who is the Author?

I'm hesitant to post my real name online, so you can call me by my pseudonym, Sineae! 

I'm a writer, web developer and professional opinion-haver based in Houston, Texas. I write about a wide range of subjects, ranging from government to history to agriculture to resource economics.

### Do You Need a Freelance Writer?

As you can see, I'm a rather good writer. If you would like to hire me for some freelance work, rather that be in politics, lifestyle writing or some other domain, please feel free to shoot me an email at YeehawSineae@Gmail.com. Writing is not my profession, but I enjoy it profusely and would love to work with you to make some high-quality content.
