## What is Co-Determined?

Co-Determined! is a blog about progressive politics, cooperation, and goodwill. We have an ideological bent, writing from a sort of utopian, existentialist, social-democratic perspective. We are very interested in how government works and how it can be used to positively impact people's lives. 

## Who is the Author?

I abstain from attaching my real name to my work, because I've had very negative previous experiences doing so. My pseudonym is Sineae, and I am a university student from Texas studying economics, mathematics and religion. I plan on going to grad school to study environmental/resource economics, and am interested in working in the policy world, especially in environmental & economic policy. 

If you like the work I'm doing here, follow me on Twitter at @YeehawSineae, and consider tipping me on Venmo (@Sineae). College is expensive, and I take what I can get :-)
