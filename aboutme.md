subtitle: What is Co-Determined?
---

Co-Determined! is a blog about progressive politics, cooperation, and goodwill. Our mission is to synthesize a theory of politics and governance rooted in the following principles: 

* Everybody has a right to a dignified life and a basic standard of living. 
* We have a moral obligation to pursue that goal in a pragmatic way, winning concrete victories. 
* Material well-being is a prerequisite for the things that make life worth living, but is not sufficient.
