subtitle: What is Co-Determined?
---

Co-Determined! is a blog about progressive politics, cooperation, and goodwill. Our mission is to synthesize a theory of politics and governance rooted in the following principles: 

* Everybody has a right to a dignified life and a basic standard of living. 
* We have a moral obligation to pursue that goal in a pragmatic way, winning concrete victories. 
* Material well-being is a prerequisite for the things that make life worth living, but is not sufficient. 

We believe in the role of the government in improving lives through public funding for critical social services, appropriate regulation of industry, the establishment of a universal social safety net, and public investment in R&D. We also believe in internationalism without interventionism, a secular and pluralistic government, democratic reform, and promoting a sense of solidarity and duty among our neighbors.
