Forestry is, put simply, the science of taming forests. Foresters seek to not only understand how forests work, but how humans can interact with them. Foresters maintain our forests, expand them, and work to intercept and avert potential threats. This work is crucial and highly relevant to the subject matter of this blog, which is focused on how Americans can work together to collectively improve our country. 

Nature is our mutual inheritance: every person has a right to enjoy it. Foresters, at least in the public sector, are the folks tasked with upholding that right from those who seeks to exploit and degrade our inheritance. The Forest Service is the formal body within the American government tasked with maintaining our country's publicly-owned forests, as well as providing private landowners with the resources necessary to maintain their forests properly. 

The Forest Service has a long and storied history, and throughout this article, I hope to walk you through its founding narrative. 

### Table of contents

This is a rather long article, so for ease of use, I have included a table of contents. It traces the birth of the United States Forest Service from the work of Franklin Hough to its formalization under Gifford Pinchot and the Theodore Roosevelt administration.

## Introduction:

The concept underlying the Forest Service seems rather banal to modern sensibilities: we ought to sustainably manage our most critical natural resource, the forests. But, for much of our history, we did not do this (and frankly, we do not do a particularly good job today). The formation of the Forest Service represented a sharp break, and ultimately a new vision for the role of government. The conservationists and foresters argued that the role of the government was not only in preserving the rights of individual people, but more broadly, in preserving our rights to share in the bounty of the Earth. 

Below is a map of all lands currently held by the National Forest Service - roughly 10% of our country's landmass. There are 154 seperate National Forests, which are distinct from National Parks. National forests are defined by their multi-use nature. They are simply publicly-owned plots of land that are managed sustainably by the Forest Service, and often provide a wide mix of lumber, grazing, recreation & mineral access to the American people.

## The Acquisition of American Public Lands

## The Birth of the Forest Service
### Franklin Hough’s Rise and Fall: 

In many ways, the U.S. Forest Service was born on the western edges of the Adirondack mountains of New York. Franklin Hough, often credited as the founder of American forestry, was the son of a yankee physician in a quaint town upstate. His father was often the only doctor in the area, and tended to the everyday medical needs of his community. 

From a young age, Franklin was continually exposed to untouched nature. The Adirondacks shaped Hough, and through his work, would later become the site of one of America's first great conservation efforts. He was known for being a serial hiker, and possessing an endless fascination with the mountains' minerals - a fascination so great that he would discover his own, a hydrated oxid of aluminum and magnesium that we now call Houghite. 

Hough became a doctor like his father, but he never stopped loving the Adirondacks and the natural world. While practicing medicine, he compiled volume upon volume of research on local biology and geology. The sheer thoroughness of his work was nearly unmatched, and the breadth at which he wrote and researched was astounding. Franklin Hough, a soft and gentle man who spoke little, rapidly became a phenomenon in the scientific community. He was a Benjamin Frankin figure: one who knew much about everything.

Hough became distinguished not only as a doctor, but as a biologist, historian, statistician, and eventually a crusader. 

### The Special Agent

Due to his repute as an extremely accomplished statistician, Hough was appointed to supervise the 1865 New York state census. It was here that he realized something critical: due to the economic expansion driven by the civil war, the supply of local lumber was rapidly declining, especially in the Adirondacks. The economic and environmental impacts of this cannot be understated. 

A decade later, with further evidence backing up his fears from the 1870 census, Hough gave a riling presentation to the American Association for the Advancements of Science, titled "On tbe Duty of Governments in the Preservation of Forests." It was a scathing critique of American resource management. If we did not act, Hough warned, we would look much like the Middle East: ravaged by deforestation and environmental calamity. 

The AAAS promptly formed a committee to lobby the government, one of the first acts of environmental activism in American history. Hough was appointed to chair this committee, consisting of some of the most brilliant men in American science. He became a crusader.

With the assistance of Congressman Mark Dunnell of Minnesota, the backing of the American scientific community, and his personal array of connections, Hough managed to wrangle Congress into establishing the "Office of the Special Agent" in the Department of Agriculture, given a mandate to study and analyze the conditions of American forests. 

Hough was appointed to this position. He was paid very little and given near zero resources, except for free access to American railways. He travelled the country by rail, compiling tremendous volumes of research and incontrovertible evidence of the crippled and over-exploited state of American forests. This exploitation was a mistake “made without a thought as to the probable wants of the future" for "timber is both the flesh of American industry, and a shelter from sweeping winds.” 

Hough's first report to Congress was so long that they demanded he rewrite it, capping the length at 650 pages. The politicians were convinced.

### The Division of Forestry 

And thus, the Division of Forestry was born, the direct predecessor to today’s Forest Service. Hough served as its first chief, laying the frameworks for modern American forestry. He established clubs, encouraged schools to plant trees on arbor day, and produced groundbreaking research. 

Yet his policy recommendations were flatly ignored by those in power. 

Hough’s crusade never let up, and he made both friends and enemies until the very end. In 1883, he was removed from his position by George Loring, the Secretary of Agriculture, due to a fierce personal grievance between the two. He continued to work for the Division for a while, but eventually left to pursue further research after having been ejected from his position.

Hough’s Forest Service was merely a shell of what it would become. Hough’s attempts to promote true forest management were upended by politicians, and the Division of Forestry merely remained a source of information for landowners and agriculturalists. But it had promise - promise enough to become one of the most complex and ambitious agencies in the United States government.
