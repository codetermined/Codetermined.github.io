### The Forest Service:

This time a century ago, the Forest Service was a tiny and insignificant branch of the American government. Today, it administers 10% of the American landmass. 

The concept behind the Forest Service seems rather banal to modern sensibilities: we ought to manage one of our most critical natural resources, the forests, in a systemic, cohesive and sustainable way. But truthfully, it was rather revolutionary.

### Franklin Hough’s Rise and Fall: 

In many ways, the U.S. Forest Service was born on the western edges of the Adirondack mountains of New York. Franklin Hough, often credited as the father of American forestry, was the son of a yankee physician in a quaint town upstate. His father was often the only physician in the area, and tended to the everyday medical needs of his community. 

Franklin followed in his father’s footsteps. Yet, he was not content merely being a doctor. On the outskirts of the Adirondacks, Franklin Hough developed a consuming and obsessive love of the natural world. He accumulated volumes of research early on in his medical practice, and even discovered a local mineral that we now call Houghite. 

His work was impressively thorough, quickly garnering the attention of locals. The fascinating thing about Hough is the sheer breadth of his knowledge. He was an accomplished physician, a competent biologist, a legendary statistician, a well-versed historian, and a revolutionary forester. 

He was the Benjamin Franklin of American forestry. He was a soft and tender man who spoke little and wrote endlessly and of everything. 

Hough was appointed to supervise the 1865 New York state census, and realized something critical: the supply of AMerican lumber was declining rapidly. The economic and ecological implications of this were horrific, and Hough took it upon himself to compile as much research on this lumber shortage as humanly possible. 

A decade later, with further evidence uncovered during the 1870 census, Hough gave a riling presentation to the American Association for the Advancements of Science.

His report was titled “On the Duty of Governments in the Preservation of Forests.” It was a scathing critique of American management of Her natural resources, and Hough drew a damning picture of the future awaiting us if we did not act. We would, he argued, look much like the Middle East: a previously fertile and prosperous region turned to wasteland due to the exploitation and enslavement of nature. 

His calls for land use regulations, conservation efforts, and the establishment of professional forestry infrastructure was so loud and so clear that the AAAS instantly rallied behind him and formed a committee to lobby the government. It consisted of nine brilliant foresters, agriculturalists, botanists and anthropologists. 

Hough chaired this committee, and our softly-spoken protagonist launched his crusade. 

He rapidly became the public face of the American conservation movement. He rapidly rose to the top of several major American forests organizations, and clearly articulated a national interest in preserving and protecting our natural resources. 

As Hough’s profile rose, so did his friends and enemies. One ally that Hough found in Congress was Rep. Mark Dunnell of Minnesota, a stalwart conservationist. Dunnell wrangled Congress into establishing the Office of the Special Agent in the Department of Agriculture, with a mandate to understand the conditions of American forests. 

Hough was appointed to this position, and rapidly compiled incontrovertible evidence of the crippled and over-exploited state of American forests. This exploitation was a mistake “made without a thought as to the probable wants of the future, for timber is both a supply of crucial materials for building and a shelter from the sweeping winds.” 

Hough was paid nothing, and given very little funding to conduct his research. Nevertheless, he travelled across the country (using his free access to railroads) to compile a tremendous volume of data. He published his first Congressional report, and the results struck the Congress. 

And thus, the Division of Forestry was born, the direct predecessor to today’s Forest Service. Hough served as its first chief, laying the frameworks for modern American forestry. He established clubs, encouraged schools to plant trees on arbor day, and produced groundbreaking research. 

Yet his policy recommendations were flatly ignored by those in power. 

Hough’s crusade never let up, and he made both friends and enemies until the very end. In 1883, he was removed from his position by George Loring, the Secretary of Agriculture, due to a fierce personal grievance between the two. He continued to work for the Division for a while, but eventually left to pursue further research after having been ejected from his position.

Hough’s Forest Service was merely a shell of what it would become. Hough’s attempts to promote true forest management were upended by politicians, and the Division of Forestry merely remained a source of information for landowners and agriculturalists. But it had promise - promise enough to become one of the most complex and ambitious agencies in the United States government.
