Humans love to tell stories. We tell stories about ourselves, about our environment, about our history, and about God. These stories are often axes around which societies organize. Regardless of their truth, every institution that underpins human civilization derives from some kind of (likely false) story that we tell ourselves. 

These stories are often religious - Jewish families, for example, recite the story of the Exodus every Passover, reading from Hagaddah, and having their children recite lines almost like a play. The majority of American Jewry doesn’t actually believe the Exodus happened as recanted, because there is little to no archaeological evidence for that and American Jews tend to eschew fundamentalism. In fact, even wholly secular (and overtly atheist) Jews gather annually to fulfill the Jewish obligation to recant the story of the Exodus to their children annually. They do this knowing that the story is very likely incorrect - and to what aim? 

We mythologize our past because, by doing so, we build a more cohesive society. The Passover rituals serve a function: to directly and viscerally engage the Jewish people with the narrative of the Torah, and in the process, build a stronger sense of community and peoplehood among the Jewish nation. To that end, the truth of the stories is relatively unimportant. 

This use of mythologized history is everywhere. The grand American narrative, for example, is blatantly untrue: the American founding fathers were not progressive visionaries fighting for liberty and democracy. It is much more complex than that. In fact, the concept of a shared moral consensus amongst our founders is in-and-of-itself a mythologized historical fabrication. Many of our founders were terrible aristocrats, and many of them held humans in unbearably horrific bondage as slaves kept in line through state-sanctioned terrorism.

The political right in America has done a fantastic job at mythologizing the American historical narrative to support their political ends. In fact, I would argue that they have virtually monopolized this field for years. The American left has, of late, began to hit back. This takes two forms:
	
* The Howard Zinn Model: mythologizing history by portraying it as a series of struggles of the “little guy” against the “big bad guy”
* The Hamilton model: mythologizing history by distorting the “big bad guys” and imposing politically progressive values upon them. 

I am of the belief that both of these historical mythologies are vital for the left to utilize and deploy, but broadly, I find the Hamilton model to be far more versatile. Americans are a people with a great deal of patriotism, and the right has deployed their version of this model with tremendous success.
